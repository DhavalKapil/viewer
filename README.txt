Viewer

A client/server java application to transmit changes on files on the client side to the server side immediately.

My laptop does not have an external port to attach another monitor. So I developed this program so that I could code on my laptop on and view the webpage on my desktop PC.

Currently you need to set up meta http-equiv to refresh and content to 1 in your html file to make it work.

Usage:

java Viewer <server/client> <port> <file lists>
